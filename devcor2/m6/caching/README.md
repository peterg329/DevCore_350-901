# HTTP Caching Examples
This directory contains a simple test script, output log file, and
packet capture of HTTP caching in action. I used my personal
website at `http://njrusmc.net` with a few 1-2 MB sized files to
demonstrate the technology.

## Reference files
There are two reference files included in the `data_ref/` directory:
  * `output.txt`: A transcript of the output generated by the script
    for comparison purposes.
  * `demo.pcapng`: The packet capture file used for screenshots in
    the slides. You can explore it in more detail if you like.
