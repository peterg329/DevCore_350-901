# Manage Cloud and Network Infrastructure with Terraform

This directory contains the Terraform configuration files and installation
Bash script for the corresponding content. The `data_ref/` directory contains
an example output of the router resource (`aws_instance`) after being created,
which may help with troubleshooting.

Optionally, you can install Terraform VIM coloring, as I did:
`git clone https://github.com/hashivim/vim-terraform.git ~/.vim/pack/plugins/start/vim-terraform`
